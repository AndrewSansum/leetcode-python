# My LeetCode Python Solutions

Solutions for problems at: https://leetcode.com/

My account can be found at: https://leetcode.com/FoxtrotEuphony/

The aim of this repo is for me to expand my Python skills while also practicing maintenance of a personal, structured repo through git.

## Running solutions

Each solution is coupled with a basic test suite in that folder, which can be run straight up as a Python file.

Alternatively, each solution function is wrapped in a Solution class and can be called from that. This is to match the format required for LeetCode submission.

NB: Code was originally written and tested in Python 3.9.7, so I can't guaruntee success on other versions.
